# What is 'Look Out!'?

<Summary>
   <span class="text-primary">Look Out!</span> is a groundbreaking horror game that utilizes the Tobii Eye Tracker system to create a spine-chilling experience. By tracking the player's eye movements, the game introduces unique gameplay mechanics that can both manipulate and terrify the player. The game begins innocently enough, with a normal workday scenario, but quickly descends into a nightmarish reality. The psychological terrors in this game are intensified by the eye tracking mechanics. You'll be constantly aware of what you are looking at, and might even start feeling like you're being watched yourself...
</Summary>

Look Out! Is a Horror Game incorporating the [Tobii Eye Tracker](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5/) system.

This game was an exploratory prototype to see what effect eye-tracking could have on gameplay

Eye tracking can be used in two ways: You can determine whether the player is physically looking at a certain object, but you can also determine whether the player is not looking at an object.

This provides ample oppertunity to mess with the player phsycologically.

The game starts off as a regular, normal work day. The player receives an e-mail and is tasked to pick up a few documents that need shredding from their coworkers. The contents of these e-mails quickly grow more and more disturbing, and something is clearly off... 

After the player completes a few tasks, the entire office scene suddenly turns into an otherworldy version of itself. The scene turns dark, red, and moody. Coworkers are replaced by creatures that seem like your coworkers, but have glowing red eyes that always seem to look directly at you. If you look at them directly, they get disturbed and start chasing you.

Look at some images of how the game changes looks:

Exploring further, the player will come across hostile monsters which slowly move towards you whenever you're not looking at them. These may remind you of the Weeping Angles from Doctor Who. These force players to face their fears, as the players need to look directly at these horrendous monsters to survive.
Finally, there are creatures which are only visible out of the corner of your eye. They dissappear whenever the player looks at them, making it impossible to get a good look at them. These add an extra layer of psychological terror, they make the player feel watched, but the player can never truly figure out what was watching them..
The player then receives a mysterious message, leading (or luring ..?) them towards the dark basement. Would you dare to tread down those steps?
