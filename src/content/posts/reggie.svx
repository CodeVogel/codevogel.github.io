# What is Reggie?

<Summary>
   <span class="italic text-primary">"Reggie, his cousin, two scientists and most likely the end of the world‚Äù</span> is an adventure about time travel and its consequences. Its rich, quirky, plot involves a grumpy scientist from the sixteenth century, black holes, time travel, dinosaurs, a gnome University, alternative dark dimensions and an unexpected final villain who likes the universe without science better. Humour is a constant and frequent plot twists keep the player guessing about what will happen next!
