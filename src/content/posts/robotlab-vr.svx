# What is Robotlab VR?

<Summary>
   <span class="text-primary">Robotlab VR</span> was the first big VR project I worked on. At the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences' esteemed Robot Lab, we recognized the potential dangers associated with working directly with robotic arms. To address these concerns, we set out to create a tool that would allow students to practice and refine their skills in a risk-free virtual setting.
</Summary>

# The goal

The Robot Lab was coping with a limited availability of physical robots for training purposes, and the potential for damage caused to those robots by improper handling. With this in mind, we developed a serious game that provides students with a safe and immersive training experience. The game allows learners to navigate through various scenarios, honing their ability to control and manipulate robotic arms before they ever step foot into a real-world laboratory. They familiarize themselves with the usage of the Flexpendant - a controller designed specifically to control such robots.

By simulating real-life situations, students can experiment, learn, and grow without the fear of physical repercussions. 

# My contributions

I made a realistic model of the Flexpendant, and mapped the buttons and joysticks so that the user experience is as close to the real thing as possible. I implemented the physics of the robotic arm, and programmed a few of the mini-games that students can play to practice their skills. 

I also oversaw the art direction for this project, and composed some atmospheric music for this project, enhancing the immersive experience. The aim was to foster an ambiance that amplifies students' concentration and focus during their virtual training sessions.
